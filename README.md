# SLMtools

SLMtools is an extensible, hierarchical, object-oriented package written in
Python3 with classes for buildset (multiple related builds to be compared),
build parameters, material, and part details. This data can be written to and
read from a range of data formats including Microsoft spreadsheets and the
open, language-independent, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
Calculation tools included provide simple weld pool modelling, normalised and
volumetric energy density calculations and parameter comparisons and
conversions between pulsed and steady state laser systems to allow a degree of
predictive capability. Input parameters and results such as part density can be
visualised and tabulated using included methods.
